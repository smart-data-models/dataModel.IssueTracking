  An entity of type `ServiceRequest` is an acceptable Open 311 service request. Such entity encompasses all the properties defined by Open 311 at [POST Service Request](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/#post-service-request) and [GET Service Request](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/#get-service-request). Using this data model and a FIWARE NGSI version 2 implementation it is straightforward to implement a service compliant with the Open 311 specifications.
