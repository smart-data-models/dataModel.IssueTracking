## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `attributes`: As per the [Service Definition](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/#get-service-definition) structure defined by Open 311.  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `effectiveSince`: The date on which the service type was created. This date might be different than the entity creation date  - `group`: A category to group this service type within. This provides a way to group several service request types under one category such as sanitation  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `jurisdiction_id`: The unique ID of the legal entity of the service (i.e. city).  - `keywords`: A comma separated list of tags or keywords to help users identify the request type. This can provide synonyms of the service_name and group.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `open311:metadata`: This field is not strictly needed as the proposed entity encompasses the attribute definition as well. If defined, its value must be `true` if the `attributes` property is defined and its array value is not empty. Otherwise it must be equal to `false`  - `open311:type`: realtime: The service request ID will be returned immediately after the service request is submitted. batch: A token will be returned immediately after the service request is submitted. This token can then be later used to return the service request ID. blackbox: No service request ID will be returned after the service request is submitted. Enum:'realtime, batch, blackbox'.   - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `provider`: Provider of the service  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `service_code`: The unique identifier for the service request type.  - `service_name`: The human readable name of the service request type.  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be Open311ServiceType    
Required properties  
- `id`  - `type`    
As per [Open311](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/#get-service-list) an entity of type `ServiceType` is an acceptable 311 service request type. A request type can be unique to the city/jurisdiction. Please note that this data model has not been harmonized  style. We have decided to keep the same property names and structure, although we strongly believe the Open311 model can be leveraged.

#### Open311_ServiceType NGSI-LD key-values Example    
Here is an example of a Open311_ServiceType in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.
